# Curseek: The AI That Thinks by Asking — An Open Invitation to Co-Create

> 🌱 **This is more than a project—it's an experiment. And we need your help to grow it.**

CURSEEK began with a simple but powerful idea: **what if AI could make us better thinkers by asking better questions?** While today's AI excels at answering, we're exploring how it can guide human thought through Socratic dialogue.

Right now, Curseek is a proof-of-concept—a working prototype showing the potential of question-driven AI. But it's far from finished. We have the vision, a basic implementation, and a strong belief in the direction. What we need now is **your creativity, your code, and your perspective**.

## 🙌 Join the Experiment

This isn't just another open-source project—it's an open invitation to redefine how humans and AI think together. Whether you're a developer, designer, educator, or just someone passionate about better thinking, there's a place for you here.

**We're especially looking for help with:**
- Enhancing the question-generation logic
- Improving voice interaction via MCP
- Designing better memory and context management
- Creating specialized role templates (coach, therapist, interviewer)
- Building integration with other tools and platforms

## 🚀 Current Status
- ✅ Working prototype with local DeepSeek model
- ✅ Basic question-driven dialogue system  
- ✅ Chroma-based memory for context awareness
- 🔄 Early stage—full of potential and possibilities

## 💡 Why Contribute?
This is a chance to shape something meaningful from the ground up. Unlike polishing another chatbot, we're pioneering a new form of AI interaction—one that enhances rather than replaces human intelligence.

Your contributions will help build:
- More intuitive and natural questioning flows
- Richer role-playing capabilities
- Smoother multi-modal experiences
- Real-world applications in education, coaching, and creativity
